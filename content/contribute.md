The HAL management console is 100% open source. It's developed for and by its community of users. We are grateful for all contributions, whether it be a new feature, a bug fix, wiki entires, helping other members, or even just filing a bug report. The relationship is symbiotic, every contribution you make encourages others to in turn contribute in ways that will likely benefit you. 

Getting involved is easier than you think. All resources that you need are available on the internet.

# Build it

The first step to get started is to build HAL yourself. This requires creating a GitHub account, forking HAL, and cloning your private fork. The [build & run]({{< relref "development/build-run.md" >}}) page contains complete instructions for this.
