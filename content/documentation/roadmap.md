HAL is community-driven and as such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs and contributions. You can find a list of planned issues and feature requests in our [issue tracker](https://issues.jboss.org/projects/HAL/issues), but this page is a good starting point to see where we are going.

For the next minor releases we want to concentrate on stability, bug fixing and supporting new resources of the management model. Beyond that we've identified some major enhancements and topics we'd like to work on:

- Evolve JavaScript API
- Push Dynamic JavaScript Extensions
- Enhance Macro Recording
- More Monitoring
- Support for OpenShift

Please [get in touch]({{< relref "documentation/contribute.md#get-in-touch" >}}) if you think anything important is missing on the roadmap.
