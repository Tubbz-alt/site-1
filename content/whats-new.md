Starting with version 3.x we've rewritten the console from scratch. We still use a similar [technical stack]({{< relref "development/architecture.md" >}}), but we removed a lot of old and deprecated code, refactored the main business logic and rewrote pretty much all of the UI related code. We moved from [GWT widgets](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/RefWidgetGallery.html) to [Elemento](https://github.com/hal/elemento) and prepared the codebase for the upcoming GWT 3.0 release. We also fully adopt [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org/) now.  

Finally we took the opportunity to enhance the existing features and added support for many new subsystems and attributes. The following sections shows some highlights of the latest version. For all details see the [3.0.0.Final release notes]({{< relref "releases/3.0.0.Final.md" >}}).
